The **Red Sea crisis** has emerged as a significant geopolitical conflict since October 19, 2023, 
when the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen initiated a series of missile and drone attacks targeting Israel and commercial vessels in the Red Sea. 
This escalation is closely linked to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which began shortly before the Houthis' actions, 
as they declared solidarity with Hamas and aimed to disrupt maritime trade in response to Israel's military operations in Gaza. 
The international community is closely monitoring these developments due to their potential implications for global trade and regional stability.
